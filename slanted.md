# Complementary Questions

## Questions

7.1. It means that the chipher involves a unique method and unique key that is kept a secret to you and whoever the message is
directed to. If the pattern of the cipher is a secret and changes the message enough to remain a secret between the people corresponding,
then the cipher is secure.

7.2. Caesar's chipher isn't secure because it is based off of shifting the ASCII values of numbers, which is a language that many
people know about and is open to the public. The pattern therefore isn't difficult to decrypt because the same thing happens to each
character of the message; it's a rotational cipher. Additionally, the length of the words in the message all stays the same, so one
could figure out parts of messages purely based on word length. For example, seeing a word with one letter narrows it down to few words,
such as "i" or "a". From there, someone could detect the key, and from there, they could shift back the whole message to its original form.
Finally, this cipher is widely known about, so its not a secret between correspondances anymore and therefore it's not secure.

7.3. Patterns become repetitive if you see enough encrypted messages, and therefore the patterns can be detected. Additionally,
if one were good at unscrambling words, they'd be able to figure out the original message without too much difficuly, especially
because all the original characters remain in the encrypted message, just in a different order.

7.4. The message would end up being the same because each letter would be brought down to its own row but would join back up
in the end in the same order.

7.5. A hashed password has nothing to do with the original characters of the message, while an encrypted message is based off of the
original message -- it is an altered form of it. So, you can work backwords from an encrypted message to get the original message,
but you can't work backwards from a hashed password, because it is what we call a "one way" transformation.

7.6. See `slanted.py`.
