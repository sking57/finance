# It Terns Out

## Questions

3.1. 4 bits

3.2. 3 trits

3.3. 4 distinct values

3.4. 27 distinct values

3.5. 39

3.6. -39

3.7. +-0--

3.8. Instead of detecting whether there is electrical current or not through a certain computer part, which would be represented by
two states, - 0 and + can all be stored if some computer component can toggle through 3 states. Perhaps these states aren't just
"on" or "off", but instead "fully on", "halfway on", or "off"; in other words, the intensity (voltage) of the electricity could be measured
to create more than just two states denoting whether electricity is present or not. p -n -p and n -p -n transistor pairs could provide
the three desired voltage pairs. Alternatively, these three states could be denoted
through light, with vertical polarized light denoting one state (like +), horizontal polarized light denoting another (like -), and
no-intensity to express another state (like 0). This is how optical ternary computers work.


## Debrief

a. the background information was pretty useful. For the last question, though, I used the internet:
