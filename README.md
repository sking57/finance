# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

We plan to create a web-based application for people in the Boston area to use when they have free time but are not sure what to do.
This website will include a survey for users to fill out based on how much free time they have, how much money they are willing to spend,
where they are located, what they enjoy, if they are hungry and if so what they like to eat, etc. Then, through some sort of backend
algorithm, our program will plan out what the user does in their free time, whether that be go for a hike, rent a bike, go to the movies,
or go to a certain restaurant. Depending on how this all goes/whether the scope could be bigger or not, our program will also display the
estimated total price of the excursion and suggest transportation.
Ideally, the program will also be able to do the same things for groups of people (again depending on how big we want the scope to be)
Basically, there are a lot of features that can be added on or removed depending on the desired scope.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names, and who are their section leaders?

## Do you have any questions of your own?

How do we determine if the scope of our project is too little or big?
