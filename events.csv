She spent her weekends exploring the different regions of Italy and wants to give you a similar experience through food. Juli&#39;s recipes will awaken your senses and introduce you to new options for flavorful meals at home. In addition to learning a new cooking style, you&#39;ll enjoy tastes of three local New England wines that pair perfectly with recipes we’ll be making, courtesy of The Massachusetts Wine Shop.

In short, the Paleo diet is about eating real whole foods so you can feel your absolute best while healing and nourishing your body. The Menu: Roasted Carrot and Coconut Soup sourcing veggies and herbs from Stillman&#39;s Farm Peruvian roasted chicken from Chestnut Farms with aji verde (green sauce) made with local herbs  Roasted Yucca &quot;fries&quot; from Siena Farms Massaged kale salad with Q&#39;s nuts and sweet & sour apple and cashew vinaigrette  This menu is gluten free and dairy free; however, we are not a certified gluten free or dairy free kitchen, so there&#39;s always a slight risk of contamination.

About Chef Cleo Bell Cleo was born and raised in Washington, DC. She attended McGill University in Montreal and has a BA in Cultural Anthropology. After graduating, she moved back to DC and began working at local restaurants, such as Againn, a British Isles-inspired gastro-pub and Komi, a high-end Mediterranean restaurant. She has spent 2 summers as the Head Chef for the Hog Island National Audubon Society summer camp in Maine, working with local farms to bring fresh food to the Island and to happy campers. Cleo is thrilled to have the opportunity to cook and teach at Boston Public Market, with the whole Market to source from and the whole of Boston to serve. At first glance, it might seem a strange road from cultural anthropology to cooking, but food and cooking are integral to the expression and transference of culture. As they say: culture begins at the table. By concentrating on serving local, sustainable foods, Cleo hopes to elevate the experience of the diner and to make a positive impact on the local food community.

The Finger Lakes of Upstate NY. Born and raised 15 miles south of Ithaca, its the heart and soul of who I have become.  For this dinner I will be pairing cheeses from the Finger Lakes Cheese Cheese Alliance with Finger Lakes Wines I will be sharing tales of farms within a stones throw the school that not only raised me, but also my son, my daughter through 3rd grade and much of family and friends.  Its a bubble all it&#39;s own that I can&#39;t wait for you to explore and all on the eve of my 45th birthday ... come celebrate with me.  1st Course Engelbert Farms Organic Feta, Roasted Grape, Apple Tartlet (Nichols NY) Barry Family, Brian&#39;s Bright Idea, Red Sparkling Wine, Finger Lakes Looking for something completely different? Look no further than this carbonated blend of Cabernet Franc, Riesling, Chardonnay, and some native grapes. Fun and fruity, yet completely dry, this is the ultimate odd-ball that seems to pair well with just about everything.    2nd Course Jerry Dell Farm Organic Cheddar Soup, Compressed Smoked Pears (Freeville, NY) Atwater Estate Vineyards, Dry Rose, Seneca Lake Juicy and ripe, this pretty dry Rose offers a bounty of black-plum and berry flavors glazed with caramelized sugar. Zippy acidity refreshes the mid-palate guiding an invigorating cherry-blossom finish.  3rd Course Muranda Cheese Company Bel Ciello Grilled Endive Caesar, Bel Ciello Ribbons, Cured Egg Yolk (Waterloo, NY) Dr. Konstantin Frank, Rkatsiteli, Keuka Lake Rkatsiteli, introduced to America by Dr. Konstantin Frank, has its origins on the slopes of mount Ararat, where winemaking began. The cool climate of this area produces a fruity wine with a light herbaceous aroma. Chilled, it goes well with salmon and other fish dishes, Chinese food and hearty dishes which might overpower more delicate wines. Dr. Konstantin Frank, known as &quot;the father of vinifera&quot; in the Eastern United States, pioneered viticultural methods that a generation of Eastern wineries have used to grow these superb varieties of European grapes. 4th Course Shtayburne Farm Cracked Pepper and Mushroom Pierogi, Creme Fraiche, Caviar (Rock Stream, NY) Six Mile Creek Winery, Seyval Blanc, Cayuga Lake Floral notes precede subtle hints of lemon and grass on the palate in this dry, crisp wine.

Apples on the orchard floor layered over aromas of toffee, dust, beeswax and hay lead to a muscular and embracing mid-palate with flavors of ripe red apple, wild mint and something animalistic. The finish is an interplay between sweet and bitter, the leathery tannin full and present amidst still ripe fruit and brown sugar.   6th Course Lively Run Cayuga Blue, Hanger Steak, Salt Potato Masa Harina Crusted Bravas (Interlaken, NY) Chateau LaFayette Reneau, Cabernet Sauvignon, Seneca Lake A delicious Cabernet opening with ripe cherry fruit in the nose and on the palate leading to a good balance of oak and soft tannins. Finishing with good acidity and chocolate. This wine will age very well for the next several years. 7th Course  Sunset View Creamery Smoked Havarti and Apple Beignets (Odessa, NY) Villa Bellangelo, Moscato, Semi-Sparkling, Seneca Lake Our 2012 Semi-sparkling Moscato is made from 100% Valvin Muscat grapes in the classic Italian &quot;frizzante&quot; (semi-sparkling) method. See why everyone is talking about this wine!Winemaker Notes: Aromas of lychee fruit, pineapple and tropical flowers highlight this sweet wine with a hint of carbonation that makes for a great appetizer or dessert pairing or  South Hill Cider, Pommeau, Cayuga Lake,  South Hill Pommeau is a blend of barrel-aged Apple Spirits (Eau de Vie) with unfermented and unfiltered apple cider.

In this 3-hour still life workshop, Spaceus member Sharon Lacey will introduce students to some of the tried and true methods of the 19th century art academies. By learning how to sight properly, you will be able to draw accurate representations of things, stuff, and whatnot. Observational drawing is a valuable skill for artists and non-artists alike. It can deepen your engagement with reality, help you focus on the present moment, and inspire you to look longer at things. Drawing is a splendid, low-tech way to record your impressions of the visible world.  You’ll need drawing paper, pencils, and charcoal. About the instructor:  Painter Sharon Lacey studied the figure extensively at the New York Academy of Art, and continued her training in art historical techniques at the University of London. Her studio is located in Somerville, MA.  ",2019-01-05 13:00:00,20 Brattle Street,Cambridge,

Finance for Poets,http://boston.eventful.com/events/finance-poets-/E0-001-117803434-8?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic," TSNE MissionWorks&#39; Better Nonprofit Management Training Series runs from September 2017 to June 2018. Join us this year as we present workshops on essentials issues in nonprofit management such as supervision, financial management, fundraising, communications, and more! We have trained more than 3,000 nonprofit professionals on the skills needed to take the lead in their work and their careers. Visit for full workshop descriptions and series information: http://www.tsne.org/bnmts/workshops Workshop Description Many nonprofit leaders advance in their careers because of their “programmatic” excellence. They are tireless advocates, gifted clinicians, and imaginative designers of services. Their frontline experiences enhance their effectiveness as managers. They become trusted leaders of programs and people. Too often, however, the nonprofit leader’s career path leaves an “experience gap” when it comes to financial management. Although leaders may have dealt with budgets and funders at the program level, when they move into executive positions they need to adopt an unfamiliar organizational perspective and a strategic approach to financial matters. For many nonprofit leaders, this experience gap is a source of anxiety and frustration. For some, it fosters avoidance of financial issues – even when the leader knows that these issues are crucial to the organization’s health and service to the community. If this scenario resonates with you, then this workshop is for you. The Finance for Poets workshop is designed for nonprofit leaders who do not have formal training or deep experience in accounting or financial management. It is especially focused on helping these leaders overcome the barriers of jargon and intimidation that obstruct them from engaging fully in financial discussions with colleagues, board members, and external stakeholders. We won’t talk down to you. Rather, we will respect your intelligence and boost your confidence so that you can embrace financial management rather than avoid it. Learning Objectives We will explore the budgeting process through hands-on exercises and lively discussion. We’ll see that the core idea of budgeting is planning and that communication is more important than calculation. If you can plan a family vacation, you can lead an effective budget process. We will explain the basic financial statements that every corporation — from a telecommunications giant to a neighborhood soup kitchen — uses to tell the story of its financial condition and performance. We’ll also identify the many issues that financial statements do not address. We will explain the value of an independent audit and how it is conducted. We’ll provide time for questions and open, collaborative discussion. Bring your good spirits, your open mind, your unpublished haiku, your art history degree, and the questions you were afraid to ask anyone else. Together, we’ll get past the jargon and focus on what nonprofit leaders need to know and do in the domain of financial management to build strong organizations. Target Audience Rising nonprofit managers with little or no background in financial management, non-classically trained financial staff, wearers of many hats.
