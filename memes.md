## Questions

5.1. SQL might store the unique user id of the commentor, the actual text of the comment, and the date/time that the comment was posted.

5.2. Perhaps there is a fourth column denoting the id of the post that is being replied to, and there is a separate SQL table that
assigns an id number to each post. This is a process of referencing another table as needed to save space is called normalizing,
and it's how we avoid storing redundant data.

5.3. See `memes.html`.

## Debrief

a. This took a lot of stack overflow and W3 schools-type research on my part. I feel like we never really lerned javascript as well
as other languages so it took a lot of searching.

b. 200
