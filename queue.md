## Questions

10.1. In C, an array would be chosen over a linked list if the capacity of the shirts is a constant that doesn't change, because then
no memory needs to be dynamically allocated -- we know the length of the array ahead of time and we know it won't change. This can
be advantageous because we know exactly how much storage will be used and also it is an easier struct for us to understand and work
with (linked lists can become confusing), and also we can easily index through the array to find a certain value, whereas with a linked
list this takes more time.

10.2. A linked list is useful if we aren't sure how much memory will be needed to store the information and we want to be able to
dynamically allocate it.


10.3. Python uses less lines of code and therefore takes less human-time to write it.
It is more succcint and easier to understand because of the abstractions it uses.

10.4. C generally has a faster run time than python, so that might be advantageous if we are working with larger sets of data and want
to cut back on run time

10.5. q.append(s), q.remove(c) where c is a different shirt
